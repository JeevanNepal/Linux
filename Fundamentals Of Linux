What is linux?
Linux is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. 


Mkdir -p india/mumbai: it helps to create a directory whith parent directory and all those child directory will be created.



Working with Hardware in Linux.

dmesg is a command ot display the message in linux.

lspci - Perepheral component interconnect.
lsblk - list info about block devices.
lsmem --summary : List the memory size in the system.
free -m : shows the total and used memory in the system.


/ root: the top of the file system directory.
/bin: binaries and other executable programs.
/home: home directory
/etc: system configuration files.
/opt: optional or third party software.
/tmp: temporary space typically cleared on reboot.
/usr: user related programs.
/var: variable datas most notably logs files.
/cgroup: controls group hierarchy.
/boot: files needed to boot the operating system.
/dev: devices files typically controlled by operating system and the system administrators.
/lib: system libraries.
/export: shared file systems.
/lib64: system libraries, 64bits
/lost+found Used by the file system to store recovered files after a file system check has
been performed.

/media Used to mount removable media like CD-ROMs.
/mnt Used to mount external file systems.
/proc Provides information about running processes.
/sbin System administration binaries.
/selinux Used to display information about SELinux.
/srv Contains data which is served by the system.
/srv/www Web server files.
/srv/ftp FTP files.
/sys Used to display and sometimes configure the devices and busses known to the
Linux kernel.
/tmp Temporary space, typically cleared on reboot. This directory can be used by the
OS and users alike.
/usr User related programs, libraries, and documentation. The sub-directories in /usr
relate to those described above and below.
/usr/bin Binaries and other executable programs.
/usr/lib Libraries.
/usr/local Locally installed software that is not part of the base operating system.

ESSENTIAL Linux Commands.
-------------------------

pwd Displays the present working directory.
cd Changes the current directory.
ls Lists directory contents.
cat Concatenates and displays files.
man Displays the online manual.
clear Clears the screen.
exit Exits the shell or your current session.









Teach Yourself to Fish
Knowing where executable commands live and the man command can take you a long way. You
can teach yourself how to use Linux with this method, but it would be a long, slow process. More
often than not, the man command will be used as a quick reference. It would be nearly impossible
to memorize every option for every command and there is no need to do so when you have the
man command at your fingertips.
To get help for the man command type the letter h while viewing a manual page. That will give you
a list of commands you can use to navigate or search. Here is the concise version.
Enter - Move down one line.
Space - Move down one page.
g - Move to the top of the page.
G - Move to the bottom of the page.
q - Quit.
An environment variable is a storage location that has a name and a value. The one we are
interested in at the moment is PATH. The PATH environment variable contains a list of directories
that contain executable commands. You can determine the value of PATH by prepending it with a
dollar sign ($PATH) and using the echo command to display its value to the screen.
$ echo $PATH
/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin
When you type in a command at the prompt and press Enter, that command will be searched for
in the directories in your $PATH. In this example, /bin will be searched first. If the command is
found it will be executed. If it is not found, then /usr/bin will be searched and so on. If no
executable command is found that matches your request, you will be politely told that it cannot be
found.
$ whatsupdoc
-bash: whatsupdoc: command not found
If you want to know exactly where a command is located you can use the which command. If the
program cat is located in /usr/bin and in /usr/local/bin, the one which will get executed
depends on your $PATH.
$ which cat
/bin/cat
$ which tac
/usr/bin/tac
Putting this all together, you can start looking at what is in each directory in your $PATH and use
the man command to discover what each one of them does and how to use them. Remember, to
exit the man command type the letter q.
$ echo $PATH
/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin
$ cd /bin
$ ls
awk diff cal cat cp date du echo grep groups less more
$ man diff
NAME
diff - compare two files
...
$ cd /usr/bin
$ ls
clear crontab cut dos2unix find kill mv pstree pwd sed strings touch ...
$ man touch
Note that the output of the above ls commands was truncated. In reality there can be hundreds of
commands in /bin and /usr/bin.
Many commands will provide hints for how to use them at the command line. Some commands
will accept the -h flag, others will accept --help, and some will refuse to give you any help at all.
$ cal -h
Usage:
cal [options] [[[day] month] year]
Options:
-1, --one show only current month (default)
-3, --three show previous, current and next month
-s, --sunday Sunday as first day of week
-m, --monday Monday as first day of week
-j, --julian output Julian dates
-y, --year show whole current year
-V, --version display version information and exit
-h, --help display this help text and exit
$ diff --help
Usage: diff [OPTION]... FILES
Compare files line by line.
-i --ignore-case Ignore case differences in file contents.
--ignore-file-name-case Ignore case when comparing file names.
...
If you are not sure what command to use, you can search through the man pages with
man -k KEYWORD. From there you can read the man page for the command or ask it for help with
-h or --help.
$ man -k calendar
cal (1) - display a calendar
zshcalsys (1) - zsh calendar system
