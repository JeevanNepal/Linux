What is linux?
Linux is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. 


Mkdir -p india/mumbai: it helps to create a directory whith parent directory and all those child directory will be created.

If you get the installation issue for ubuntu using wsl --intsll, use the below command to resolve the issue.

>wsl --unregister ubuntu
followed by
>wsl --install
fixes the problem for ubuntu atleast

Working with Hardware in Linux.
==============================

dmesg is a command ot display the message in linux.

lspci - Perepheral component interconnect.
lsblk - list info about block devices.
lsmem --summary : List the memory size in the system.
free -m : shows the total and used memory in the system.


/ root: the top of the file system directory.
/bin: binaries and other executable programs.
/home: home directory
/etc: system configuration files.
/opt: optional or third party software.
/tmp: temporary space typically cleared on reboot.

Unix Specific Directories








ESSENTIAL Linux Commands.
========================

pwd Displays the present working directory.
cd Changes the current directory.
ls Lists directory contents.
cat Concatenates and displays files.
man Displays the online manual.
clear Clears the screen.
exit Exits the shell or your current session.









Teach Yourself to Fish
======================

Knowing where executable commands live and the man command can take you a long way. You
can teach yourself how to use Linux with this method, but it would be a long, slow process. More
often than not, the man command will be used as a quick reference. It would be nearly impossible
to memorize every option for every command and there is no need to do so when you have the
man command at your fingertips.
To get help for the man command type the letter h while viewing a manual page. That will give you
a list of commands you can use to navigate or search. Here is the concise version.
Enter - Move down one line.
Space - Move down one page.
g - Move to the top of the page.
G - Move to the bottom of the page.
q - Quit.
An environment variable is a storage location that has a name and a value. The one we are
interested in at the moment is PATH. The PATH environment variable contains a list of directories
that contain executable commands. You can determine the value of PATH by prepending it with a
dollar sign ($PATH) and using the echo command to display its value to the screen.
$ echo $PATH
/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin
When you type in a command at the prompt and press Enter, that command will be searched for
in the directories in your $PATH. In this example, /bin will be searched first. If the command is
found it will be executed. If it is not found, then /usr/bin will be searched and so on. If no
executable command is found that matches your request, you will be politely told that it cannot be
found.
$ whatsupdoc
-bash: whatsupdoc: command not found
If you want to know exactly where a command is located you can use the which command. If the
program cat is located in /usr/bin and in /usr/local/bin, the one which will get executed
depends on your $PATH.
$ which cat
/bin/cat
$ which tac
/usr/bin/tac
Putting this all together, you can start looking at what is in each directory in your $PATH and use
the man command to discover what each one of them does and how to use them. Remember, to
exit the man command type the letter q.
$ echo $PATH
/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin
$ cd /bin
$ ls
awk diff cal cat cp date du echo grep groups less more
$ man diff
NAME
diff - compare two files
...
$ cd /usr/bin
$ ls
clear crontab cut dos2unix find kill mv pstree pwd sed strings touch ...
$ man touch
Note that the output of the above ls commands was truncated. In reality there can be hundreds of
commands in /bin and /usr/bin.
Many commands will provide hints for how to use them at the command line. Some commands
will accept the -h flag, others will accept --help, and some will refuse to give you any help at all.
$ cal -h
Usage:
cal [options] [[[day] month] year]
Options:
-1, --one show only current month (default)
-3, --three show previous, current and next month
-s, --sunday Sunday as first day of week
-m, --monday Monday as first day of week
-j, --julian output Julian dates
-y, --year show whole current year
-V, --version display version information and exit
-h, --help display this help text and exit
$ diff --help
Usage: diff [OPTION]... FILES
Compare files line by line.
-i --ignore-case Ignore case differences in file contents.
--ignore-file-name-case Ignore case when comparing file names.
...
If you are not sure what command to use, you can search through the man pages with
man -k KEYWORD. From there you can read the man page for the command or ask it for help with
-h or --help.
$ man -k calendar
cal (1) - display a calendar
zshcalsys (1) - zsh calendar system

Working with Directories
=========================

Directories are simply containers for files and other directories. They provide a tree like structure
for organizing the system. Directories can be accessed by their name and they can also be
accessed using a couple of shortcuts. Linux uses the symbols . and .. to represent directories.
Think of . as "this directory" and .. and "the parent directory."
Symbol Description
. This directory.
.. The parent directory.
/ Directory separator. Directories end in a forward slash and this is often assumed.
The directory separator is optional for the last subdirectory in a path or command. For example,
the following commands work identically.
$ cd /var/tmp
$ cd /var/tmp/
Using the shortcuts can make navigating easier. For example, type cd.. to go to the directory
just above your current directory.
$ pwd
/home/bob
$ cd tpsreports
$ pwd
/home/bob/tpsreports
$ cd ..
$ pwd
/home/bob
$ cd ..
$ pwd
/home
$ cd .
$ pwd
/home
The cd . command did not take you anywhere. Remember that . is "this directory" and .. is
"the parent directory." Another shortcut for navigating directories is cd - . This command takes
you to the previous directory. The environment variable that represents your previous working
directory is OLDPWD . So, cd - and cd $OLDPWD are equivalent.
$ pwd
/home/bob
$ cd /var/tmp
$ pwd
/var/tmp
$ echo $OLDPWD
/home/bob
$ cd -
/home/bob
$
How would you execute a command that is in your current directory? Assume your current
directory is your home directory. By default your home directory is not in your $PATH . Here is how
to do that.
$ ./program
Why does that work? Well, . represents "this directory", / is the directory separator, and
program is the program to execute. You can always use the full path to be explicit. Here are two
ways to execute program .
$ pwd
/home/bob
$ ./program
$ /home/bob/program
Creating and Removing Directories
The mkdir command is used to create directories and the rmdir command removes them.
mkdir [-p] directory - Create a directory. Use the -p (parents) option to create intermediate
directories.
rmdir [-p] directory - Remove a directory. Use the -p (parents) option to remove all the
specified directories. rmdir only removes empty directories. To remove directories and their
contents, use rm .
rm -rf directory - Recursively removes the directory and all files and directories in that
directory structure. Use with caution. There is no "trash" container to quickly restore your file from
when using the command line. When you delete something, it is gone.
$ mkdir newdir
$ mkdir newdir/product/reviews
mkdir: Failed to make directory "newdir/product/reviews"; No such file or
directory
$ mkdir -p newdir/product/reviews
$ rmdir newdir
rmdir: directory "newdir": Directory not empty
$ rm -rf newdir
$ ls newdir
ls: newdir: No such file or directory
$ pwd
/home/bob
$ cd ..
$ pwd
/home
