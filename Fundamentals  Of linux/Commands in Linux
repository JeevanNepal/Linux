What is linux?
Linux is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. 


Mkdir -p india/mumbai: it helps to create a directory whith parent directory and all those child directory will be created.

Teach Yourself to Fish
======================

Knowing where executable commands live and the man command can take you a long way. You
can teach yourself how to use Linux with this method, but it would be a long, slow process. More
often than not, the man command will be used as a quick reference. It would be nearly impossible
to memorize every option for every command and there is no need to do so when you have the
man command at your fingertips.
To get help for the man command type the letter h while viewing a manual page. That will give you
a list of commands you can use to navigate or search. Here is the concise version.
Enter - Move down one line.
Space - Move down one page.
g - Move to the top of the page.
G - Move to the bottom of the page.
q - Quit.
An environment variable is a storage location that has a name and a value. The one we are
interested in at the moment is PATH. The PATH environment variable contains a list of directories
that contain executable commands. You can determine the value of PATH by prepending it with a
dollar sign ($PATH) and using the echo command to display its value to the screen.
$ echo $PATH
/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin
When you type in a command at the prompt and press Enter, that command will be searched for
in the directories in your $PATH. In this example, /bin will be searched first. If the command is
found it will be executed. If it is not found, then /usr/bin will be searched and so on. If no
executable command is found that matches your request, you will be politely told that it cannot be
found.
$ whatsupdoc
-bash: whatsupdoc: command not found
If you want to know exactly where a command is located you can use the which command. If the
program cat is located in /usr/bin and in /usr/local/bin, the one which will get executed
depends on your $PATH.
$ which cat
/bin/cat
$ which tac
/usr/bin/tac
Putting this all together, you can start looking at what is in each directory in your $PATH and use
the man command to discover what each one of them does and how to use them. Remember, to
exit the man command type the letter q.
$ echo $PATH
/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin
$ cd /bin
$ ls
awk diff cal cat cp date du echo grep groups less more
$ man diff
NAME
diff - compare two files
...
$ cd /usr/bin
$ ls
clear crontab cut dos2unix find kill mv pstree pwd sed strings touch ...
$ man touch
Note that the output of the above ls commands was truncated. In reality there can be hundreds of
commands in /bin and /usr/bin.
Many commands will provide hints for how to use them at the command line. Some commands
will accept the -h flag, others will accept --help, and some will refuse to give you any help at all.
$ cal -h
Usage:
cal [options] [[[day] month] year]
Options:
-1, --one show only current month (default)
-3, --three show previous, current and next month
-s, --sunday Sunday as first day of week
-m, --monday Monday as first day of week
-j, --julian output Julian dates
-y, --year show whole current year
-V, --version display version information and exit
-h, --help display this help text and exit
$ diff --help
Usage: diff [OPTION]... FILES
Compare files line by line.
-i --ignore-case Ignore case differences in file contents.
--ignore-file-name-case Ignore case when comparing file names.
...
If you are not sure what command to use, you can search through the man pages with
man -k KEYWORD. From there you can read the man page for the command or ask it for help with
-h or --help.
$ man -k calendar
cal (1) - display a calendar
zshcalsys (1) - zsh calendar system

Working with Directories
=========================

Directories are simply containers for files and other directories. They provide a tree like structure
for organizing the system. Directories can be accessed by their name and they can also be
accessed using a couple of shortcuts. Linux uses the symbols . and .. to represent directories.
Think of . as "this directory" and .. and "the parent directory."
Symbol Description
. This directory.
.. The parent directory.
/ Directory separator. Directories end in a forward slash and this is often assumed.
The directory separator is optional for the last subdirectory in a path or command. For example,
the following commands work identically.
$ cd /var/tmp
$ cd /var/tmp/
Using the shortcuts can make navigating easier. For example, type cd.. to go to the directory
just above your current directory.
$ pwd
/home/bob
$ cd tpsreports
$ pwd
/home/bob/tpsreports
$ cd ..
$ pwd
/home/bob
$ cd ..
$ pwd
/home
$ cd .
$ pwd
/home
The cd . command did not take you anywhere. Remember that . is "this directory" and .. is
"the parent directory." Another shortcut for navigating directories is cd - . This command takes
you to the previous directory. The environment variable that represents your previous working
directory is OLDPWD . So, cd - and cd $OLDPWD are equivalent.
$ pwd
/home/bob
$ cd /var/tmp
$ pwd
/var/tmp
$ echo $OLDPWD
/home/bob
$ cd -
/home/bob
$
How would you execute a command that is in your current directory? Assume your current
directory is your home directory. By default your home directory is not in your $PATH . Here is how
to do that.
$ ./program
Why does that work? Well, . represents "this directory", / is the directory separator, and
program is the program to execute. You can always use the full path to be explicit. Here are two
ways to execute program .
$ pwd
/home/bob
$ ./program
$ /home/bob/program
Creating and Removing Directories
The mkdir command is used to create directories and the rmdir command removes them.
mkdir [-p] directory - Create a directory. Use the -p (parents) option to create intermediate
directories.
rmdir [-p] directory - Remove a directory. Use the -p (parents) option to remove all the
specified directories. rmdir only removes empty directories. To remove directories and their
contents, use rm .
rm -rf directory - Recursively removes the directory and all files and directories in that
directory structure. Use with caution. There is no "trash" container to quickly restore your file from
when using the command line. When you delete something, it is gone.
$ mkdir newdir
$ mkdir newdir/product/reviews
mkdir: Failed to make directory "newdir/product/reviews"; No such file or
directory
$ mkdir -p newdir/product/reviews
$ rmdir newdir
rmdir: directory "newdir": Directory not empty
$ rm -rf newdir
$ ls newdir
ls: newdir: No such file or directory
$ pwd
/home/bob
$ cd ..
$ pwd
/home

Viewing and Editing Files:
=========================
Here are some simple commands that display the contents of files to the screen.
cat file - Display the entire contents of file.
more file - Browse through a text file. Press the Spacebar to advance to the next page. Press
Enter to advance to the next line. Type q to quit viewing the file. Commands are based on the
vi editor, which is covered in the next section.
less file - Like more but allows backward movement and pattern searches.
head file - Output the beginning (or top) portion of file.
tail file - Output the ending (or bottom) portion of file.
This is how you might examine a file named file.txt with the commands cat , tail , and more .
$ cat file.txt
This is the first line.
This is the second.
Here is some more interesting text.
Knock knock.
Who's there?
More filler text.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
The dog was rather impressed.
Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
All my base are belong to you.
Finally, the 12th and last line.
$ head file.txt
This is the first line.
This is the second.
Here is some more interesting text.
Knock knock.
Who's there?
More filler text.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
The dog was rather impressed.
Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
$ tail file.txt
Here is some more interesting text.
Knock knock.
Who's there?
More filler text.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
The dog was rather impressed.
Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
All my base are belong to you.
Finally, the 12th and last line.
$ more file.txt
Here is some more interesting text.
Knock knock.
Who's there?
More filler text.
...
$
By default head and tail only display ten lines. You can override this behavior and tell them to
display a specified number of lines. The format is -n where n is the number of lines you want to
display. If you only want to display the first line of a file use head -1 file . Want to display the
last three lines? Then run tail -3 file .
$ head -2 file.txt
This is the first line.
This is the second.
$ tail -1 file.txt
Finally, the 12th and last line.
$
Viewing Files In Real Time
Using cat can be a fine way to view files that have fairly static content. However, if you are trying
to keep up with changes that are being made in real time to a file, cat is not the best choice. A
good example of files that can change often and rapidly are log files. For example, you may need
to start a program and look at that program's log file to see what it is doing. For this case, use the
tail -f file command.
tail -f file - Follow the file. Displays data as it is being written to the file.
$ tail -f /opt/app/var/log.txt
Oct 10 16:41:17 app: [ID 107833 user.info] Processing request 7680687
Oct 10 16:42:28 app: [ID 107833 user.err] User pat denied access to admin
functions

Editing Files:
=============
Nano
If you need to edit a file right now and do not want to spend any time learning obscure editor
commands, use nano . Nano is a clone of pico , so if for some reason the nano command is not
available, pico probably is. It's not as powerful as some other editors, but it's definitely easier to
learn.
When you start nano you will see the file's contents and a list of commands at the bottom of the
screen. To run the commands, replace the caret symbol (^ ) with the Ctrl key. For example, to
exit nano type Ctrl-x.
Editing in nano is quite easy. The up and down arrow keys will take you to the previous or next
lines as expected. The right and left arrow keys let you navigate forwards and backwards on the
same line. Simply type the desired text into the editor. To save the file, type Ctrl-o . If you forget
to save the file before you exit, nano will ask you if you want to save the file. To learn more type
