Flexible Capacity
● You can aggregate multiple storage devices
into a single logical volume.

Easily Resize Storage While Online
● Expand or shrink file systems in real-time
while the data remains online and fully
accessible.
Online Data Relocation
● Easily migrate data from one storage device
to another while online.

● You can use human-readable device names of
your choosing.
/dev/vg_database/lv_db_logs vs /dev/sdb3
Convenient Device Naming

Disk Striping
● Increase throughput by allowing your system
to read data in parallel.
Data Redundancy / Data Mirroring
● Increase fault tolerance and reliability by
having more than one copy of your data.

Snapshots
● Create point-in-time snapshots of your
filesystems.

Logical Volume Creation Process
● Create one or more physical volumes.
● Create a volume group from those one or
more physical volumes.
● Create one or more logical volumes from the
volume group.

LVM Summary
● Logical Volume Manager introduces layers of
abstraction including:
○ Physical Volumes (PVs)
○ Volume Groups (VGs)
○ Logical Volumes (LVs)
