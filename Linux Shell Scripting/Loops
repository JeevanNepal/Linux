Loops in Shell Scripting:

For Loop:

If we need to run a same command multiple times then a for loop should be used.

for mission in lunar-mission jupiter mission ....... n-mission.

do
create-and-launch-rocket $mission 

done


If the mission names are thousands it maybe be difficult to type all the mission names:
So we store all the missions name in a file and run it with `cat mission-name.txt`

Ex:
for mission in `cat mission-name.txt`

do
create-and-launch-rocket $mission 

done


Another way is to use $ symbol:
Ex: 
for mission in $(cat mission-anme.txt)

do
create-and-launch-rocket $mission 

done


Use of For loop when you have to:
1. Execute a command or set of commands many times.
2. Iterate through files.
3. Iterate the lines within a file.
4. Iterate through the output of a command.


Lab Questions:
Let us now update the script /home/bob/launch-rockets.sh to read mission names from a file.



Mission names are located at /tmp/assets/mission-names.txt


for mission_name in $(cat /tmp/assets/mission-names.txt)
do
    bash /home/bob/create-and-launch-rocket $mission_name
done


While Loop:
Uses:
    1. Execute a commmand or set of commands multiple times but we are not sure how many times.
    2. Execute a commmand or set of commands until a specific condition occurs.
    3. Create infinite loop.
    4. Menu driven programms.
    
  Ex: while true
        do
        echo "1. Shutdown"
        echo "2. Restart"
        echo "3. Exit Menu"
        read -p "Enter your choice": Choice
        
        if [ $choice -eq 1 ]
            then
            shutdown now
         elif [ $choice -eq 2 ]
         then
         shoutdown -r now
         elif [ $choice -eq 3 ]
         then
         break
         else
         continue
         done
         fi
