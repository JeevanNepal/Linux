Loops in Shell Scripting:

For Loop:

If we need to run a same command multiple times then a for loop should be used.

for mission in lunar-mission jupiter mission ....... n-mission.

do
create-and-launch-rocket $mission 

done


If the mission names are thousands it maybe be difficult to type all the mission names:
So we store all the missions name in a file and run it with `cat mission-name.txt`
