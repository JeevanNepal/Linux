Conditional Logics in Shell Script:

If the rocket launch fails the nwe must run rocket debug (mission_name)command to check why it failed.

ststement:

if [ $rocket_status="Failed" ]

then 
 rocket-debug $mission_name
 
elseif [ $rocket_status="Success" ]

  then
  
echo "This is successful"

else

echo "This is failed or successful"

fi





Conditional Operators:

[ string1 = string2 ]

[ "abc" = "abc" ] - If string 1 is exactly equal to string 2.

[ "abc" != "abc" ] - IF string1 is not string 2.

[ 3 -eq 3 ] - If number 1 euqal to number 2 (true).

[ 2 -ne 2 ] - if number 1 is not equal to number 2(false).

[ 4 -gt 3] - If number 1 is greated then number 2(true).

[ 4 -lt 5 ] -If number 1 is less then number 2 (true).



Another way of specifying conditional operation:

[[ "abc" > "bcd"  ]] - This symbol checks if the sorted string is in alphabetical order or not. if abc comes after(>) bcd false.

[[ "abc" < "bcd" ]] - This symbol checks if the sorted string is in alphabetical order or not. if abc comes before(<) bcd true.


AND &&  & OR || operators:

[ condition1 ] && [ condition2 ]

[ condition1 ] || [ condition2 ]

[[ condition1 && condition2 ]] - If we are using double parenthesis braces we do not need to separate the two conditions.
